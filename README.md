# Welcome to the AsteriaUI codespace!

This is the codespace for the collaberative Mudlet UI project for the Asteria Mud. Our main goal is to provide an easily accessible yet robust user interface for all of Asteria's players!

# So what does that mean?

AsteriaUI is a modular framework with various elements that can all be installed on an as-needed basis! By utilizing self-contained modules, we've made it possible for users to customize their interface experience to suit their individual needs. Take a look at the Wiki for a selection of screenshots from users who've made the interface their own!

# Sounds great, how do I get it?

Using the following code, you can install the base UI package. It'll automatically run the installation wizard, and you can simply select 'Basic' to have the wizard download and install a ready-to-play variant of the UI that will work for many players!

[Insert Lua install line here when ready.]

# I want [thing]! Is it available?
